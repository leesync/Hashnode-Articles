**TL;DR:** Payments infrastructure is more than just APIs and retries. If you can’t trace the lifecycle of a single transaction, you risk losing customer trust, failing audits, and slowing down product velocity.

In this post, I dive into why every modern fintech needs a robust control plane and how to start building one using our open-source blueprint.

## Why Fintechs Hit the Same Infrastructure Roadblock

Fast-growing fintechs often launch with well-designed APIs and a smooth user experience. But as transaction volumes increase and edge cases multiply, predictable issues emerge:

> * Payments get stuck in unknown states
>     
> * Support teams struggle to explain what happened
>     
> * Engineers get called at 2 AM without the right context
>     
> * Audits fail due to missing event trails
>     
> * Refunds drag on, frustrating customers
>     
> 
> Why does this happen? Because most teams focus on building the **data plane**—the part that executes payments—but overlook the **control plane**, which governs, tracks, and secures the payment flows.
> 
> ## What Is a Control Plane in Fintech?
> 
> Borrowing from cloud infrastructure terminology:
> 
> * The **data plane** performs the actual processing.
>     
> * The **control plane** manages orchestration, state transitions, and enforcement of rules.
>     
> 
> In fintech, a control plane:
> 
> * Orchestrates payment state transitions
>     
> * Captures retries, approvals, and failures
>     
> * Provides comprehensive audit trails
>     
> * Offers business-centric observability (e.g., “Where is payment ID 123xyz and why is it pending?”)
>     
> * Embeds regulatory compliance into system behavior
>     
> 
> Without a control plane, you’re essentially running sensitive batch processes with blindfolds on.
> 
> ## What You Need (But Probably Don’t Have Yet)
> 
> Building a true control plane requires:
> 
> * Stateful orchestration (AWS Step Functions)
>     
> * Event stream visibility (EventBridge, Kafka, SNS)
>     
> * Correlated observability (logs, metrics, and traces tied to payment IDs)
>     
> * Automated compliance hooks (IAM audits, PII redaction, encryption at rest and in transit)
>     
> * Region-aware failover and partitioning
>

> Sounds complex? That’s because it is.
