Hi all,

Did you know, with the rise of subscription-based services according to Statista global e-commerce losses due to online payment fraud were estimated at $41 billion, with projections indicating further increases.

What does this tell us?

This escalating trend underscores the critical need for robust security measures in payment processing systems and whilst this is a top priority field-level encryption is necessary to protect sensitive data.

In this post you will learn the importance of securing sensitive data with Field-Level Encryption, its advantages, and actionable steps for implementation, use cases and its limitations.

Let’s consider traditional methods for contextual purpose. What makes edge encryption different?

**Edge Encryption vs. Traditional Methods**

Traditional encryption occurs at the backend, leaving data vulnerable during transit. Edge encryption locks down sensitive information at the very first touchpoint, minimising risk.

Imagine trusting your customers’ payment details to a system that leaves them exposed—your reputation would take a hit faster than you could say “data breach.” AWS CloudFront’s Field-Level Encryption (FLE) ensures secure payment processing while enhancing your edge computing capabilities.

## What is AWS CloudFront Field-Level Encryption - FLE?

AWS CloudFront Field-Level Encryption is a security feature that encrypts sensitive data at the edge before sending it to your backend servers.

Unlike traditional TLS, which encrypts the entire payload, FLE encrypts specific parts of the payload, such as credit card numbers, ensuring enhanced security and compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS.

Implementing solutions like AWS CloudFront’s Field-Level Encryption can play a pivotal role in safeguarding sensitive customer data.

Let’s consider why.

**1\. Granular Security:** FLE allows for the encryption of individual sensitive fields, such as credit card numbers or personally identifiable information (PII), while leaving non-sensitive data in plaintext.

This means that even if an attacker gains access to a database, they only encounter encrypted fields, rendering the sensitive information unreadable without the proper keys.

**2\. Reduced Attack Surface:** By encrypting only the most sensitive fields, FLE minimises the amount of data that is exposed in plaintext.

This selective encryption limits the potential points of attack, making it harder for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.

**3\. Compliance Simplification:** FLE simplifies adherence to industry regulations like PCI DSS by ensuring that sensitive data is protected at all times.

This allows businesses to focus more on their core operations without the constant worry of compliance breaches due to exposed sensitive information.

**4\. Client-Side Encryption:** FLE often employs client-side encryption, meaning that sensitive data is encrypted before it leaves the client’s environment.

This ensures that data is never transmitted in plaintext, further protecting it from interception during transmission.

Processing payments securely is non-negotiable in today’s digital-first world. AWS CloudFront Field-Level Encryption provides a robust mechanism to encrypt sensitive data at the edge, ensuring security, compliance, and performance.

Have you thought about how FLE works?

Let’s paint a picture of how this works in payment processing:

Your web application sends a public key to the customer’s browser. The customer enters their credit card details, which are encrypted using this key.

The encrypted data is forwarded through CloudFront to your backend. Your backend decrypts the data and processes the payment. It’s like handing over a locked box to the bank, with only the bank having the key.

AWS CloudFront FLE relies on public-key encryption. Here’s a step-by-step overview:

1\. **Define Encryption Configuration**:

Create an encryption profile using AWS KMS or an external RSA public key.

**Asymmetric Encryption with RSA**

FLE typically utilises RSA-based asymmetric encryption for key management.

In this method, a symmetric key (often used for encrypting the actual data) is itself encrypted using RSA.

The public key encrypts the symmetric key, which can then be safely transmitted or stored.

Only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt this symmetric key, allowing them to access the encrypted data.

**Advantages of RSA in FLE.**

* **Enhanced Security:** RSA adds an additional layer of security because even if an attacker intercepts the encrypted symmetric key, they cannot decrypt it without access to the private key.
    
* **Key Management:** Organisations can manage their own keys securely without relying on third-party services, reducing risks associated with external breaches.
    

2\. **Integrate with CloudFront**:

Attach the encryption configuration to your CloudFront distribution.

3\. **Encrypt Data at the Edge**:

CloudFront encrypts the specified fields in the incoming request payload using the public key.

4\. **Secure Backend Decryption**:

Only your backend servers with the private key can decrypt and process the sensitive data.

## **What is the primary purpose of Field-Level Encryption FLE in payment processing?**

FLE provides fine-grained encryption for sensitive data fields, such as credit card numbers or personally identifiable information (PII), to ensure they are protected at the edge and throughout their journey to the backend.

### **Is Field-Level Encryption PCI DSS Compliant?**

Yes, it is! Encrypting sensitive fields at the edge aligns perfectly with PCI DSS requirements. It ensures payment data is encrypted in transit and at rest, reducing your compliance burden and risk exposure.

## **How does FLE enhance the security of sensitive payment data compared to traditional encryption methods?**

Traditional encryption secures the entire payload, but FLE focuses on encrypting specific sensitive fields, reducing the attack surface and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Additionally, FLE employs RSA-based asymmetric encryption, adding an extra layer of protection.

AWS CloudFront Field-Level Encryption provides fine-grained encryption for sensitive data, making it applicable across a variety of industries and scenarios where data security is paramount. Below are key use cases:
