# FinTech Faster Payments on AWS

Practical guides, reference architecture, and deployable examples for building **real-time payments systems** (UK Faster Payments / SEPA-like) on AWS. Focus: reliability, low latency, auditability, compliance, and secure AI decisioning.

## About

This repo collects architecture diagrams, and reference code for engineers and architects building faster-payments platforms on AWS. Content is written for technical decision-makers: CTOs, platform engineers, SREs, and payment product owners.



## Core topics covered

* Real-time payments architecture patterns (ingest → routing → clearing → settlement)
* Tokenisation & secure data vaults (KMS + DynamoDB patterns)
* Idempotency, exactly-once delivery, and deduplication strategies
* Queue agents, stream processing, and intelligent routing with LLM agents (audit trail + tokenised prompts)
* Multi-region resilience, latency compensation, and failover strategies
* Observability: tracing, metrics, distributed logs, and tamper-evident audit trails
* FinOps for payments: cost-per-transaction models and autoscaling strategies
* Regulatory mapping: GDPR, FCA/PSR, PCI considerations for payments data


## Security & Compliance checklist (quick)

* Envelope encryption (AWS KMS) for all sensitive payloads; use `EncryptionContext`.
* Token vault pattern: KMS + DynamoDB; detokenize endpoints protected and audited.
* Enforce TLS for all service-to-service traffic. Use VPC endpoints for DynamoDB/KMS where required.
* IAM: least-privilege roles for Lambdas/services; require approved role assumption for admin tasks.
* Audit & evidence: CloudTrail for KMS + DynamoDB, immutable logs for detokenize operations, retain per compliance retention policy.
* Data sovereignty: map data flows and restrict storage to allowed regions per `compliance/` guidance.
* Incident response: include incident playbook in `templates/` and run quarterly tabletop exercises.
