# FinTech Faster Payments on AWS

Practical guides, reference architecture, and deployable examples for building **real-time payments systems** (UK Faster Payments / SEPA-like) on AWS. Focus: reliability, low latency, auditability, compliance, and secure AI decisioning.

## About

This repo collects production-oriented articles, architecture diagrams, and reference code for engineers and architects building faster-payments platforms on AWS. Content is written for technical decision-makers: CTOs, platform engineers, SREs, and payment product owners.

Each article includes: a threat model, architecture diagram, implementation snippets (CDK/Terraform + Lambda/Containers), test harnesses for latency/throughput, and a compliance checklist.

## Core topics covered

* Real-time payments architecture patterns (ingest → routing → clearing → settlement)
* Tokenisation & secure data vaults (KMS + DynamoDB patterns)
* Idempotency, exactly-once delivery, and deduplication strategies
* Queue agents, stream processing, and intelligent routing with LLM agents (audit trail + tokenised prompts)
* Multi-region resilience, latency compensation, and failover strategies
* Observability: tracing, metrics, distributed logs, and tamper-evident audit trails
* FinOps for payments: cost-per-transaction models and autoscaling strategies
* Regulatory mapping: GDPR, FCA/PSR, PCI considerations for payments data

## How to publish an article

1. Draft a markdown file in `articles/` using `templates/faster-payments-post.md`.
2. Add frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `tags`, `slug`, `primary_keyword`, `compliance_scope`.
3. Include architecture diagrams in `assets/` and link to runnable examples in `examples/`.
4. Add a short "How we measured" section for any latency/cost metrics.
5. Create a `simulations/` scenario used to test claims (load scripts, sample messages).
6. Submit a PR with screenshots, SLOs, and a 2-line TL;DR.

## Security & Compliance checklist (quick)

* Envelope encryption (AWS KMS) for all sensitive payloads; use `EncryptionContext`.
* Token vault pattern: KMS + DynamoDB; detokenize endpoints protected and audited.
* Enforce TLS for all service-to-service traffic. Use VPC endpoints for DynamoDB/KMS where required.
* IAM: least-privilege roles for Lambdas/services; require approved role assumption for admin tasks.
* Audit & evidence: CloudTrail for KMS + DynamoDB, immutable logs for detokenize operations, retain per compliance retention policy.
* Data sovereignty: map data flows and restrict storage to allowed regions per `compliance/` guidance.
* Incident response: include incident playbook in `templates/` and run quarterly tabletop exercises.

---

## Operational runbooks & SLOs

* Define SLOs: e.g., 99.99% success for authorization within 150ms, p99 latency < 300ms for critical path.
* Monitoring: end-to-end tracing (X-Ray / OpenTelemetry), payment lifecycle metrics, queue depth alerts, and anomalous detokenize spikes.
* Autoscaling: scale consumers by backlog and latency signals; implement capacity reservations for peak windows.
* DR drills: practice regional failover, reconciliation, and settlement replays using `simulations/replay`.

---

## Testing & Simulation

* Use `simulations/` to run ISO20022-like payload generators, chaos tests (latency injection, partition), and throughput benches.
* Include synthetic dataset and "how-we-measured" notes in each article to make metrics reproducible.

---

## Examples & reference implementations

* `examples/token-vault/` — KMS + DynamoDB + Lambda tokenize/detokenize (CDK + Node.js).
* `examples/queue-agent/` — intelligent queue agent example (SQS/Kinesis + Lambda/Container) with Bedrock prompt patterns.
* `examples/idempotency/` — idempotency keys + dedupe table patterns with retry/backoff examples.

---

## KPIs & success metrics

* Transactions per second (TPS) sustained and peak
* End-to-end latency (median, p95, p99) for authorization and settlement paths
* Error rate and reconciliation mismatches per 10k transactions
* Cost per 10k transactions and cost breakdown by component
* Number of audited detokenize events and unauthorized access attempts

---

## Contribution guidelines

* Fork, branch, and open a PR against `main`. Link any deployed demo or simulation output in the PR description.
* Include: architecture diagram (SVG), a runnable example (or link), SLOs, and a compliance scope section.
* One technical reviewer and one compliance reviewer must approve for posts touching cardholder data or regulated flows.
