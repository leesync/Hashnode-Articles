Let’s get started.

## **1\. Key Compliance Requirements for Fintech Payments**

Payments-focused fintechs must adhere to several regulatory standards, depending on their operating regions:

**🔹 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - Europe**

• Protects user data privacy.

• Requires data localisation (storing EU user data within EU regions).

**🔹 PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive) - Europe**

• Mandates **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** for secure online payments.

• Requires **open banking APIs** for financial data sharing.

**🔹 PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) - Global**

• Governs the handling of **credit card transactions**.

• Enforces strict security rules around **encryption, access control, and logging**.

**🔹 AML & KYC (Anti-Money Laundering & Know Your Customer) - Global**

• Requires fintechs to **monitor transactions** for fraud and illegal activities.

• Enforces identity verification before onboarding customers.

**🔹 SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls) - U.S. & Global**

• Establishes trust around **security, availability, and confidentiality** of services.

Without compliance, fintech startups risk **heavy fines, reputational damage, or loss of banking partnerships.**

## **2\. Common Challenges in Fintech Compliance**

🔴 **Data Residency & Cross-Border Transactions** – Regulations like **GDPR & PSD2** require **customer data to stay in specific regions**.

🔴 **Encryption & Data Security** – PCI-DSS demands **end-to-end encryption of payment data**. A breach could be catastrophic.

🔴 **Real-Time Fraud Detection** – Startups must detect fraud **instantly** to prevent financial crime and **comply with AML laws**.

🔴 **Audit & Logging Requirements** – Regulations require **detailed logs** of every financial transaction.

🔴 **Scalability Without Compromising Compliance** – Handling **millions of transactions per second** while meeting **PCI-DSS and PSD2** standards is tough.

This is where a **well-designed AWS architecture** comes in.

## **3\. Secure AWS Architecture for Fintech Payments & Compliance**

A secure and compliant **AWS cloud architecture** for fintech payments must include:

✅ **Multi-Region AWS Deployment** – To meet **GDPR & PSD2 data residency** rules.
